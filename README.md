## Description

A web application uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words.
Here's what sample input and output from a complete program should look like:
  * Input: "Don't you love these 'String' exercises? I do!"
  * Output: "D0n'7 y0u l0v3 7h3z3 'S7ring' 3x3rciz3z? 1 d0!"
